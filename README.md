# FSJS-TD-Unit3

This is my third project for the FullStack JavaScript Techdegree. For this project I created an interactive form.

## Features

- Total cost of workshops is being calculated when a workshop is (de)selected
- Credit card input is being validated for 13-16 numbers
- Email input is validating for a correct formatted email address
- Zip code and CVV number inputs are validated to be a certain amount of numbers
- Upon submitting the form each input provides an error when validation is failed
- impossible to submit the form untill all the inputs are correctly validated

## Additional Features

- Color selection is hidden until a design is chosen
- Provides messages depending on the validation error
